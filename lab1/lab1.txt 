Here's thefunction that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed:


def reverse_string(string):
return string[::-1]


Here's theprogram that prompts the user to enter two numbers and prints out their sum, difference, product, and quotient:


num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

print("Sum: ", num1 + num2)
print("Difference: ", num1 - num2)
print("Product: ", num1 * num2)
print("Quotient: ", num1 / num2)
Here's thefunction that takes a list of integers as input and returns the largest number in the list:


def find_largest(lst):
return max(lst)
Here's theprogram that prompts the user to enter their age and prints out a message saying whether they are old enough to vote (age 18 and above) or not:


age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age >= 18:
print("You are old enough to vote!")
else:
print("You are not old enough to vote yet.")
Here's thefunction that takes a list of strings as input and returns the string with the most characters:


def find_longest_string(lst):
return max(lst, key=len)
Here's theprogram that prompts the user to enter a number and prints out a message saying whether the number is positive, negative, or zero:


num = float(input("Enter a number: "))

if num > 0:
print("Positive")
elif num < 0:
print("Negative")
else:
print("Zero")
Here's thefunction that takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels in the string:


def count_vowels(string):
vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
count = 0
for char in string:
if char in vowels:
count += 1
return count
Here's theprogram that prompts the user to enter a sentence and prints out the sentence in all uppercase letters:


sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")
print(sentence.upper())
Here's thefunction that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers:


def find_even_numbers(lst):
return [num for num in lst if num % 2 == 0]
Here's theprogram that reads in a list of strings and prints out the strings in alphabetical order:


strings = input("Enter a list of strings separated by spaces: ").split()
strings.sort()
print(strings)
